                                                  <p>HAIYAAA!!! My name is Valentine!!!</p>

                                                  <p>
                                                            I also go by "Pancake_Eater" sometimes! <br>
                                                            I'm an aspiring computer science student hoping to continue her studies of the field further! <br>
                                                            Currently I am undergoing an independent study to freshen up my knowledge of computer science and hopefully learn some more before the new term starts! <br>
                                                            I'm planning on studying HTML to CSS, Tailwind CSS, Js, Vue.Js or React.Js, though I am inclined to the former, then PHP and Laravel for my main subjects.<br>
                                                            And if I have the time I'd love to also get into Java and C or C++!!! <br>
                                                  </p>

                                                  <p class="flex-1">
                                                            But of course, mainly I'd love to know how to host my own website to the web and more or less learn the ins and outs of full stack web development. <br>
                                                            Hopefully I can learn how to get some gigs on making webs for others before the term starts, that would be a <strong>HUGE</strong> morale boost for me! And of course it'll put me ahead of my classmates and make me less anxious!!!
